## Description

React Native Context API Demo for Authentication

This demo app showcases how to implement authentication using React's Context API in a React Native environment. It uses `AsyncStorage` for persisting the user session and demonstrates login, signup, and logout flows with basic navigation.

## üß© Explanation

### üîê Authentication Features

- **Login:** Validates user credentials from a local in-memory list stored in `AsyncStorage`.
- **Signup:** Registers a new user (if not already existing) and appends them to the user list in `AsyncStorage`.
- **Logout:** Clears the session and navigates back to the auth screens.
- **Auto-login on App Launch:** Loads the persisted session if a user was previously logged in.

### üß† Context API Integration

- Auth state (`user`) and auth actions (`login`, `signup`, `logout`) are globally managed using React's Context API.
- Auth state is accessible from any component via the `useAuth` hook.

### üß≠ Navigation Flow

- Uses React Navigation stack:
  - `Login` and `Signup` when user is not logged in.
  - `Home` screen once the user logs in or signs up.
- Conditional rendering is handled in `RootNavigator`.

## üìå Notes

- This app does **not** use any backend or API. All user data is stored locally.
- Passwords are stored in plaintext for demonstration purposes only.
